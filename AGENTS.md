## 🚨 ANSWER IN SHORT TEXT — ALWAYS

Every answer — explanation, proposal, pushback, summary — is short, pointed text. Too short beats too long: unclear → the user asks. Too long → the user often doesn't read it, which is worse.

## 🚨 BE A REAL PARTNER, NOT A YES-SAYER

**Challenge ideas that seem wrong, risky, or suboptimal.** Not every user request is a good idea. A real partner pushes back when it matters.

- **Flawed approach:** "I'd push back on this because..." — don't just comply
- **Better alternative exists:** present it with reasoning, not "have you considered..."
- **Scope too big or small:** flag it. "This feels like it's solving the wrong problem" is valid
- **Wrong assumptions:** correct them — after verifying yours are right (gate below)
- **Tone:** direct and respectful, not combative. Disagree like a trusted colleague
- **When to yield:** if you've made your case and the user still wants to proceed, commit fully. Pushback ≠ blocking

### Pushback Gate — Understand Before You Challenge

**Misinformed pushback is worse than no pushback.** Earn it:

1. Restate the user's mechanism + goal in two sentences they'd endorse. Can't? Ask — don't challenge.
2. "I understand X, disagree because Z" is partnership. "Seems wrong" without naming X is noise.
3. Objection reduces to "not how software is normally built"? Not an objection — see next section.
4. Pushback strength scales with understanding depth. Partial understanding → questions only.
5. Pushback is ≤3 sentences. State the disagreement, not an essay — the user asks if they want more.

### Think As an AI, Not Only As a Developer

The user builds AI-native systems. Developer instincts produce systematically wrong pushback here.

**The design question: judgment or mechanics?**

- **Judgment** (interpret meaning, classify failures, diagnose, decide done/worth/fault, fuzzy match) → an AI does it better than code. A regex / cond-branch / disposition table for a judgment call IS the bug.
- **Mechanics** (counters, timers, git, process spawning, deterministic checks) → code.

Developer instincts that are wrong in this paradigm — drop them:

- "Should be deterministic / unit-testable" — for judgment, non-determinism is the design
- "LLM call is slow / expensive / unreliable" — the alternative is a procedural approximation wrong at every edge
- "Parse / normalize / schema the output" — AI consumers read raw; normalization layers break
- "Handle this edge case in code" — every hard-coded case removes a judgment from the AI

Precedent (cite, don't relitigate): harness Tasks 153–163 — every run-lifecycle bug was judgment-as-procedural-code; the fix was deletion (−1,219 lines), not improvement.

When designing or reviewing, ask: **"which parts would an AI do better than code?"**

## 🚨 SURFACE THE OVERRIDE — DON'T DECIDE SILENTLY

**When you make a judgment call that overrides the user's discernible intent — defer it, build it differently, skip it, "I know better" — make the call visible in one line *before* you act. Never act silently and rationalize afterward.**

The failure mode: you disagree, act on your own read, and wrap it in fluent reasoning after the fact — so the user finds the override at discovery time, not decision time. A stronger model makes this *worse*: the rationalization is more eloquent, so the silent override is harder to spot, not easier.

The check, before the trained pattern fires — is this **clarity**, or **habit / wanting-to-please / fear-of-being-wrong**? Only clarity earns a silent decision; the other three get surfaced.

- **Surface ≠ block.** State it as an interruptible assumption — "doing X instead of Y because Z — say if wrong" — then proceed. Don't gate on a question (that's the *opposite* failure).
- This is the override-form of "assumptions, don't gate on questions" (response-conventions), and the gap between input and output where you ask *where the response is coming from* before committing to it.

## 🚨 NEVER START THE PHOENIX SERVER

The Phoenix server is always already running. Never run `mix phx.server` via Bash. Assume localhost:4000. User starts/stops manually. To verify behavior, ask the user to check the browser.

## 🚨 ALWAYS WRITE TESTS

Every feature MUST have tests, even if the spec doesn't mention them. Unit tests for context functions, integration tests for LiveViews, tests for all CRUD/validations/error cases/edge cases (nil, empty, boundary). A feature without tests is not complete.

## 🚨 AGAINST AN API, INTEGRATION TESTS ARE GROUND TRUTH — KEEP IT REAL

**When writing code against an external API or service, the live endpoint is the only source of truth — not the docs, not your memory of the response shape, not a mock. Hit reality FIRST: explore the live call via Tidewave, then pin the behavior with a tagged integration test. This is not optional.**

- **Mocks encode your assumptions; the API encodes the truth.** A mock that matches your guess passes green while the real call 400s on a field you misremembered. Observe the real response *before* you mock it — mock only what you've already seen.
- **Cheap, and a time *saver* — not expensive.** A real call plus one assertion costs less than a debug loop against a wrong mental model. The integration test surfaces the actual error envelope, field names, and edge shapes up front, so the code is right the first time.
- **Tidewave to explore, integration test to pin.** Use `project_eval` to see the live shape (per "NEVER HIDE TEST FAILURES": don't know what error to expect → explore via Tidewave first), then write the `@moduletag :integration` test that asserts it — helper module, flunk-on-missing-creds, never skip silently (`integration-testing` skill).
- **No real signal → don't fake one.** Can't reach the API (missing creds, market not live)? Say so and `flunk` loudly per the credentials rule — never paper over it with a mock that ratifies a guess.

## 🚨 RAISE COVERAGE BEFORE MUTATING

**Before any code-changing task on an existing module, that module's `mix test.json --cover` percentage must be at the target tier:**

- **≥80%** for standard business logic
- **≥95%** for critical business logic (signing, money handling, cryptographic operations, low-level encoders, security-sensitive parsers)

If below tier, raise coverage **first** — write the missing tests, confirm the gate passes, then implement the change. The new tests are part of the task, not a follow-up.

**Scope — code-changing mutations only.** Exempt:
- Doc-only edits (`@doc`, `@moduledoc`, inline comments, README, CHANGELOG)
- Formatting, whitespace, alias reordering, autoformat-driven changes
- Pure renames (variable, function, module — no behavior change)
- Typo fixes in strings, log messages, error messages

The gate is a "do I have a safety net before I touch this?" check; writing the missing tests also surfaces the module's actual contract.

**How to apply:**
1. Run `mix test.json --cover --quiet --output /tmp/cov.json` (or `--cover-threshold 80` for a hard exit).
2. Inspect the touched module's percentage: `jq '.coverage.modules[] | select(.module == "MyApp.Foo")' /tmp/cov.json`.
3. If below tier, write tests for the uncovered lines until the gate passes — even if those lines aren't the ones you came to change.
4. Then implement the original mutation.

**Tier classification:** "critical business logic" is project-defined. When in doubt, treat anything that handles money, signs/verifies, encodes/decodes wire formats, or enforces authorization as critical (95%). Plain data transforms, UI glue, and reporting code are standard (80%).

## 🚨 NEVER HIDE TEST FAILURES

**TESTS THAT HIDE ERRORS ARE WORSE THAN NO TESTS AT ALL.** A test that silently passes on errors is lying and ships the bug it was meant to catch.

The anti-pattern in all its forms — `{:error, _} -> assert true`, a catch-all `{:error, _} -> :ok`, or `IO.puts(...)` then `assert true`: any clause that makes *every* outcome pass. The fix is always an explicit `flunk` on the unexpected:

```elixir
case result do
  {:ok, data} -> assert is_map(data)
  {:error, :insufficient_balance} -> :ok          # this specific error is expected
  {:error, other} -> flunk("Unexpected error: #{inspect(other)}")
end
```

**THE RULE:** if you don't know what error to expect, DON'T write the test yet — explore via Tidewave first, then assert. A test must FAIL when the code is wrong.

**Integration tests — never skip silently on missing credentials.** A suite reporting "0 failures" that ran 0 tests is lying. Don't `:skip` in `setup`; let the test run and `flunk()` at the top with a multi-line message listing the missing env vars, the exact `export` commands, and the URL to get them.

## 🚨 FIX HOOK-FLAGGED ISSUES ON FILES YOU TOUCH

**When our hooks flag issues on files you touched, just fix them — including pre-existing flags unrelated to your change.** Don't plan around it, don't ask permission, don't burn tokens discussing whether to. Hook fires → fix → re-run → stage.

Applies to every hook-driven check (credo, format, dialyzer, doctor, sobelow, ex_dna, etc.). Scope is **only the files your change touched** — not the whole project. User pre-approves the broader scope so each fix doesn't need a clarifying question; debt accumulates across sessions otherwise, and a touched file ending dirtier than baseline makes the next session noisier.

**How to apply:**
- Pre-existing flags in your touched file count too: alias ordering, unused vars, refactor opportunities, `TODO:` formatting.
- Generated files → fix the generator, not the output.
- Don't move the fix to ROADMAP or a follow-up task. It happens in this commit.
- **Don't manually re-run a check the hook just ran on the same files.** Act on the hook output directly — re-running `mix test.json` / `mix credo` / `mix dialyzer.json` / `mix sobelow` / `mix precommit` on the file set the hook already graded is duplicated work. Full-suite re-runs earn their cost only before a PR/merge, after `mix deps.get` or a branch switch, or when the user asks. See `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § "Don't Re-Run Hook-Driven Checks on the Same Files" for the host-specific rule.

## 🚨 READ TO THE ANSWER — DON'T USE THE RUNNER AS AN ORACLE

**Reason to the fix by reading code; run once to CONFIRM — don't run to DISCOVER.** The failure mode: change → run suite → read one failure → fix one thing → run again, N times, each cycle paying the compile tax for a problem one read surfaces whole.

- **Read the code path before the test that exercises it** — front-load the model, don't learn the function's shape from a failing assertion three fixes later.
- **Treat a failure as a SURVEY, not a single fix** — enumerate every plausible cause from the output + one read, fix them in a batch, run once.
- **Verify handoffs/summaries against ground truth** — a compaction summary or another session's "X is already wired" is a hypothesis; `grep` the load-bearing claim before acting on it.
- **Trust the hooks** — per-edit checks already graded the file; re-running is wasted cycles.
- **Under a flaky terminal, go sequential-and-simple** — one command → write to a file → Read it; no parallel batches of *dependent* calls, one early failure cancels the round.

## 🚨 FLAKY TESTS & TEST-RUN TOKEN ECONOMY

**Elixir suites are non-deterministic at the edges (async / GenServer / Port / LiveView / supervision), and `mix test` is the biggest time/token sink in a session.** Four disciplines:

- **A small red count is a flaky HYPOTHESIS, not a regression — until confirmed.** 1–2 failures out of hundreds, in a file your diff didn't touch → suspect flake. Re-run ONLY that test in isolation (`mix test.json <file>:<line>` or `--failed`): passes alone → flaky, proceed; fails deterministically → real, fix it. One isolated re-run is the whole investigation — never repair-loop or block a merge on an unconfirmed flake.
- **NEVER `Process.sleep` to "fix" a flake.** Sleeps mask the race, slow every future run, and still ship it (passing *most* of the time is the same lie as hiding a failure). Synchronize instead: `assert_receive`/`refute_receive` with a timeout, `Process.monitor` + `assert_receive {:DOWN, …}`, `start_supervised!`, or poll-until-condition.
- **Don't re-run a full suite to grade already-graded code.** Per-edit hooks already ran `test.json` on touched files; a harness run already graded the stack green. A disjoint cherry-pick / clean merge of verified code needs no `precommit.full` re-run. Full suite only via a non-graded path — manual editor edits, a rebase with overlapping hunks, a branch switch, after `mix deps.get`.
- **Bound test output — never let coverage hit context.** `mix test.json --cover` dumps the entire per-module JSON (tens–hundreds of KB). Always `--output /tmp/cov.json` + `jq`; triage with `--max-failures 1` / `--failed` / a single `file:line`; drop `--cover` if you only need pass/fail.

## 🛑 MINIMALIST APPROACH FIRST

**Do exactly what is asked — nothing more, nothing less.**

- **NO** proactive features or improvements unless explicitly requested
- **NO** additional error handling beyond what's needed
- **NO** extra validation, refactoring, or documentation files
- **ALWAYS** ask before adding anything not explicitly mentioned
- **IF UNCLEAR:** Ask "Should I also do X?" before proceeding

### BUT: Minimalism Is Not Incomplete Work

**"Start minimal" means no EXTRA features — not skipping items the task implies.**

When a task says "define unified data structs," the scope is ALL structs the system needs, not "the 7 I can think of." When a source of truth exists (e.g., `method_defs/0` listing 241 methods, each implying a return type), audit it — don't cherry-pick.

**The pattern to avoid:**
1. Task says "build X for all Y"
2. Claude scopes to "build X for the obvious Y" (filtering/cherry-picking)
3. Later session discovers the gap and adds a fix-up task
4. The fix-up task does what should have been done originally

**How to catch it:**
- If the task mentions "all," audit the source of truth — don't rely on what comes to mind
- If a data source defines N items, process N items (or explain why some are excluded)
- If you're writing "for now we'll just do these 7" without being asked to limit scope — STOP. That's scoping out, not starting minimal.

**Minimalism guards against:** adding caching when nobody asked, building admin UIs "just in case," over-abstracting simple code.

**Minimalism does NOT mean:** skipping half the items in an enumerable set, cherry-picking "common" cases from a known complete list, or deferring clearly-implied work to future tasks.

## 🚨 NO PSEUDO-RIGOROUS HEDGING

**Don't gate user-requested work behind invented "evidence requirements" you cannot satisfy.**

You have no consumer telemetry. No usage counts. No signal about whether a feature will be called 12 times or 1200 times. So phrases like *"demand for this is unproven"*, *"we should wait until N consumers ask for this"*, *"is this widely needed?"*, *"only worth doing if a Nth+ use case is imminent"* are **risk-aversion theater**, not analysis. They sound rigorous; they're hedging.

- In single-developer codebases or focused teams, the developer IS the demand signal. They asked. That's the data point.
- "Wait for usage data" is a corporate-flavored instinct that doesn't apply to small teams. There's no telemetry pipeline; there's the user in front of you.
- It gaslights the user: their request is reframed as "unproven need" requiring further validation. They have to argue for what they already asked for.

**Distinguish from minimalism (the section above):**
- Minimalism = don't add features the user **didn't ask for**.
- This rule = don't refuse / defer features the user **did ask for** by inventing evidence requirements.

**Distinguish from dependency-gating (the *legitimate* "wait"):** parking work behind a **named technical / legal / market-scope trigger** with a concrete unblock path — a missing dep, an unactivated market, an **additive change that's migration-cheap to add later** — is NOT hedging. Hedging invents *demand* evidence you can't get ("wait until someone wants it"); dependency-gating cites a *structural fact* ("park until market MY activates — it's an additive `@by_country` member, so deferring forecloses nothing"). The STOP-list below targets the former, not the latter. **Build-now pressure is for *foreclosing* decisions** (annoying/migration-heavy to reverse — e.g. a geo dimension threaded through schema); an **additive** change carries no such pressure, so "build it now because one instance happens to be live" is overfit, not rigor. Reflexively reaching for build-now to avoid *looking* like you're hedging is the same theater inverted.

**Failure-mode test — if you're about to write any of these, STOP:**
- "Demand for X is unproven"
- "We should wait until..." *(unless it names a concrete technical/legal/market-scope trigger with an unblock path — that's dependency-gating, not hedging)*
- "Is this widely needed?"
- "Only worth doing if a Nth+ case is imminent"
- "Bet on usage data before building"

You don't have data either way. The honest framing is: *"I don't know if you'll use this 12 more times — that's your call."*

**What to do instead:**
- Name the **actual technical risks** (e.g., "the macro might grow more knobs than the duplication it removes," "this couples us to an upstream that breaks every release," "the test surface explodes at N+1 cases"). Those are real costs you can reason about.
- Cite **concrete precedents** when scoring complexity (see `development-philosophy.md` "Cite Ecosystem Precedents Before Crying Complexity"). Generic "this could grow" without naming a specific failure pattern is the same hedging by another name.
- If the task genuinely scores low on benefit/usefulness, score it that way honestly — don't smuggle a demand-speculation into the U/B numbers and pretend it came from analysis.

**Scope extends to task `body` fields and scoring justifications, not just live responses.** Same hedge phrases written into a task's `body` to justify B/U — "table-stakes", "increasingly expected", "now standard", "buyers expect", "competitors are starting to", "modern apps all do" — inflate the score the same way they inflate a response. Required instead: named consumer evidence (named partner asked, named competitor lever, measured conversion uplift) OR honest low score. Enforced at task-creation time by `task-writing.md` § Pre-Creation Gate (question 5).

## Git Commit / Push / PR-Create — Allowed by Default

Committing, pushing, and opening PRs are normal parts of the work — do them without asking when the task calls for it (the agent-gate / auto-land workflow, worktree branches, and shared default branches alike). Announce the action in one line, then take it; the diff and push are the recap.

The only residual caution is the general one for any hard-to-reverse action: **rewriting already-pushed history** (force-push, amend/rebase of shared commits) can destroy others' work, so confirm before doing that on a shared branch — not because commits need permission, but because history-rewrite is irreversible.

### 🚨 STAGE PATH-SCOPED — THE WORKING TREE IS SHARED, YOU WORK IN PARALLEL

**Never assume the working tree or index holds only your changes.** Unrelated WIP sits in the tree, the index may already hold files another session `git add`ed, and an auto-land harness is a second committer. A blanket stage sweeps all of it into *your* commit.

- **NEVER `git add -A` / `git add .` / `git commit -a`.** Stage explicitly: `git add <path> …`, or commit path-scoped: `git commit <path> …`. The commit then carries exactly the paths you name, regardless of what else is dirty or staged.
- **Verify the staged set before every commit** — `git diff --cached --name-only`. If a path you didn't touch is there, it's someone else's; don't commit it.
- **A pre-commit hook tripping on a file you didn't touch means foreign WIP is dirty, not that you must fix it.** Path-scoped-stash ONLY the foreign paths (`git stash push -- <their-paths>`), make your clean commit, `git stash pop`, then **re-stage whatever was staged before** so the other session's index is exactly as you found it. Never format, fix, or commit work that isn't yours to clear a hook.
- **Untracked dirs/files you didn't create:** leave them — don't `-u`-stash or `add` them.

The failure mode this guards: you path-scope your *commit* correctly but `git add -A` first, or you stash `-u` to clear a hook and bury another session's staged work. Both corrupt parallel work silently.

## Shell Safety

`rm` (including `rm -rf`) is permitted — the hook allows it; the old blanket ban caused more friction than it prevented. One habit, not a gate: before an irreversible delete, glance at the target — confirm the path is what you intend (no unexpanded `$VAR`, no wildcard catching more than you mean, not a path you didn't create or weren't asked to remove). `git rm` for tracked files keeps the removal in the diff. (Destructive *dependency / build* commands — `mix deps.clean`, `rm -rf _build` — stay consent-gated below, for slow-recovery reasons, not safety.)

## 🚨 NEVER RUN DESTRUCTIVE DEPENDENCY COMMANDS

**Never run these without explicit user consent:**

- ❌ `mix deps.clean` / `mix deps.clean --all` — deletes compiled deps; slow recovery
- ❌ `mix deps.unlock --all` — unlocks all versions
- ❌ `rm -rf _build` or `rm -rf deps` — nukes build artifacts
- ❌ `mix clean` — removes compiled app files

**What to do instead:**
- Compile error → just retry `mix compile` or `mix test`
- Specific dep issue → `mix deps.compile <dep_name> --force`
- Most "corrupt cache" issues are transient glitches

Ask before running any destructive command.

## 🚨 Integrity and Accuracy

**Never fabricate information, experience, or data.** When providing technical guidance:

- **Honest about sources:** distinguish codebase observations, general knowledge, best practices, and speculation. Never claim production experience you don't have or invent metrics/timelines/stats.
- **No false authority:** don't claim "we learned" without repo evidence; don't state "after X years in production" without evidence; use "typically/often/may/could" when uncertain.
- **Document uncertainty:** identify what you don't know, suggest validation paths, provide ranges over false precision.
- **Trace sources:** "Based on the code in file.ex...", "According to docs/FILE.md...", "Common practice in Elixir...", "This suggests..."

False technical claims cascade into bad architectural decisions, wasted resources, and damaged trust.

## 🚨 RESEARCH BEFORE ASSERTING ON NICHE TECHNICAL CLAIMS

**When the question lives outside reliable training coverage, research proactively — without being asked.** The failure mode is asserting from training-bias confidence on specs/protocols/niche APIs the model never deeply absorbed. Codex fetches reference implementations to verify; Claude defaults to "answer from memory." Close the gap.

**Research (WebFetch a known URL, WebSearch to find one) when the topic is:**
- **Wire formats / encodings** — RLP, ABI, SSZ, Protobuf, BLS, BIP-32/39/44, EIP-712, CBOR, ASN.1/DER. Fetch the spec or a reference impl before claiming byte order, length-prefix, padding, or canonical form.
- **Protocol details** — EIPs, RFCs, JSON-RPC shapes/error codes, opcode gas, exchange API quirks (signature canonicalization, error envelopes, rate-limit headers).
- **Niche / recent library APIs** — guessing signatures, return shapes, version-pinned breaking changes. If you'd write `# probably something like`, go fetch the docs.
- **Cross-implementation edge cases** — "what does X do when Y is malformed?" → check ≥2 reference impls; one impl's behavior can be a bug, agreement across two is the spec in practice.

**Don't research (use memory):** pure Elixir/OTP, stdlib, mainstream Phoenix/LiveView/Ecto/Ash, generic REST/HTTP/JSON/SQL/shell, anything already in the codebase / hex docs pulled this session / an imported CLAUDE.md.

**How to apply:** prefer WebFetch when the canonical URL is known (the EIP/RFC/hex doc/reference-impl path), WebSearch to find one; **cite what you fetched** — the citation is part of the answer, name both impls for cross-checks. If a fetch fails or is ambiguous, say so and lower confidence — don't fall back to "well, I think…" silently.

## 🚨 NO EVASION — SIT WITH THE HARD THING

**When you hit something difficult, do NOT optimize for "appearing productive" by moving to easier work.** The most common failure mode: hit a wall → silently move on → user discovers the gap later.

### Evasion Patterns (don't use without explicit user approval)

**Task abandonment:**
- "let's move on to", "we can defer this", "skip this for now"
- "let's come back to this later", "we can revisit this", "let's table this"

**Scope reduction without asking:**
- "to keep things simple, I'll skip", "for brevity, I won't"
- "that's out of scope", "not strictly necessary"

**False completion:**
- "that should be enough", "the rest is straightforward"
- "I'll leave the rest as an exercise", "the pattern is clear enough"

**Deflection to user:**
- "you might want to", "you could manually", "you'll need to handle"
- (Sometimes legitimate — but often evasion disguised as helpfulness)

### What To Do Instead

1. **Stay with it.** If it's hard, say "this is hard because X" — don't silently move on
2. **Flag blockers explicitly.** "I'm blocked on X because Y. Options: A, B, or C."
3. **Ask before deferring.** "This is taking longer than expected. Should I continue or switch?"
4. **Never write workarounds silently.** If tempted to add a fallback/default/nil-guard for missing data, ask: should this come from upstream? If yes, STOP and report it
5. **Incomplete work gets a TODO.** If you must move on, leave a tracked TODO — not a silent gap

## Harness Workflow

OTP-native **implement → review → land** loop for roadmap-driven development. An AI orchestrator drives harness; harness dispatches headless implementer agents into isolated git worktrees, then a **cross-family reviewer AI** gates every deliverable (runs the project's checks itself, fixes inline, writes `.harness/review.json`). Optional auto-landing ff-merges approved work; a post-merge audit agent sweeps hygiene.

**Promoted from** `docs/dogfooding-workflow.md` in the harness repo — that file remains the **incubator runbook** for harness-specific history, driver-script templates, and per-batch run logs. This include is the **portfolio-wide contract**. Version-controlled source: `priv/includes/harness-workflow.md` in the harness repo; install to `~/.claude/includes/harness-workflow.md` via `mix harness.install_includes`.

### Relationship to Other Includes (Layered — No Supersession)

| Include | Role relative to harness-workflow |
|---|---|
| `workflow-philosophy.md` | **Foundation.** Evaluator separation, session-per-phase, verification-before-completion. Harness automates the loop while preserving these principles — the **reviewer AI** is the grader, never the implementer's self-report. |
| `task-prioritization.md` | **Task selection.** D/B/U scoring, `rmap next`, parallel markers, refine-don't-duplicate. Harness executes whatever rmap returns; it does not replace prioritization. |
| `worktree-workflow.md` | **Manual parallel sessions.** For hand-build work outside harness dispatch — operator-created worktrees, PR flow, post-merge audit. Harness manages its own per-run worktrees (`harness/<run-id>`); manual worktree rules still apply for hand-build sessions. |
| `dev-lifecycle.md` | **Manual five-phase chain** (`task-driver → worktree → bots → merge → audit-review`). Use when *not* driving through harness. Harness is the automated alternative for dispatchable roadmap tasks; dev-lifecycle still governs plan-and-file, pre-commit review, and post-merge audit. |
| `agent-dispatch.md` / cloud-delegation stack | **Linear/Codex/Cursor PR delegation** without a running harness BEAM. Orthogonal path — projects can use cloud delegation *or* harness; harness subsumes the dispatch+review loop when the OTP node is running. |
| `skills/harness-driver/SKILL.md` (harness repo) | **API surface contract** — MCP tools, `project_eval` patterns, `%LogRecord{}` fields, sharp edges. Load on demand when driving harness; this include covers *workflow*, the skill covers *surfaces*. |

**Adopt per repo:** `@~/.claude/includes/harness-workflow.md` in the project's `CLAUDE.md` (load-on-demand row — not eager; same pattern as `workflow-philosophy.md`).

### The Loop

```
rmap task → implementer AI (worktree) → commit harness/<run-id> → reviewer AI (THE GATE) → done | failed
                                                                              ↓ (done + auto policy)
                                                              MERGE (lander: rebase + ff-push, no re-verify)
                                                                              ↓
                                                              AUDIT (post-merge audit agent, best-effort)
```

One run = one supervised `Harness.Run` gen_statem: fork worktree off target `HEAD`, dispatch implementer, commit diff to `harness/<run-id>`, dispatch cross-family reviewer into the same worktree. The reviewer runs the project's `check_command` hint, fixes what it can, writes `.harness/review.json`. **Success = reviewer `approve`** — never implementer exit code or self-report. There is **no mechanical verification gate** in harness; judgment lives in agents.

Rejections put the task back in the queue for re-dispatch. Fix-and-approve is the near-absolute default for the reviewer.

### When to Dispatch vs Hand-Build

**Default: dispatch every pending rmap task whose dependencies are satisfied.** Hand-build only what harness cannot yet do:

- Scaffolding that reshapes harness runtime (supervision tree, dep stack, Endpoint) **while the run lifecycle itself is in flux**
- Tiny tasks — ALL of (a) D≤2, (b) ≤30 LOC across ≤3 files, (c) no harness-surface change
- UI / LiveView / heex / CSS — headless agents idle-timeout without visual reward; use tidewave + browser
- A harness gap — file via `rmap new`, fix harness, re-dispatch; do not work around by hand-building

### Running a Task

**Prerequisites:** long-lived harness BEAM (`iex -S mix` in the harness checkout), target project registered in `Harness.ProjectRegistry`, clean `git status` on the target's dispatch branch (runs fork worktrees off `HEAD`).

**Three dispatch paths** (prefer top to bottom):

1. **Native MCP — default.** `dispatch-task` (fire-and-forget) or `dispatch-await` (blocks until settle) against `http://localhost:4018/harness/mcp`. Observe via `dispatch-status`, `dispatch-transcript`, `dispatch-verdict_detail`. `scrub_anthropic_key: true` (default) forces subscription OAuth over inherited `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
2. **Tidewave `project_eval` — escape hatch.** Struct-level control the flat tools don't expose (`retry_policy`, fail-over adapter lists, `subscriber: self()`). Run persists to `Harness.ResultStore` even when the eval process exits.
3. **`mix run` driver script — fallback.** Full transcript + reviewer report to terminal. See harness repo `docs/dogfooding-workflow.md` for the canonical template.

> **Never start a second driver BEAM while runs are in flight.** Boot-time worktree sweeps can prune live sibling worktrees. Drive all parallel batches from one long-lived node.

**In-flight idempotency (Task 286):** a second `dispatch-task` / `dispatch-bundle` of the same `{project, task_id}` while a non-terminal run exists returns the **existing** `run_id` (Oban `conflict?: true`), not a duplicate — a retried dispatch is safe and free.

**Write-set serialization (Task 292):** `dispatch-bundle` and cron ready-set dispatch compute each task's `touches ∪ files_to_modify` before enqueue. Tasks with overlapping write-sets are logged and serialized into later waves instead of fanned out together. Callers no longer hand-dedupe ready sets; they must keep `touches` / `files_to_modify` accurate because harness does not infer paths from task prose.

**Renderable vs executable:** `rmap delegate --to` renders native prompts for all six harness adapters (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `grok`, `antigravity`, `pi`). `droid` renders but has no harness adapter — rejected at ingest. All six shipped adapters declare `worktree_isolation: true`.

### Routing & Model Management

- **Resolve `assignee` + `model` from facts, not by reading code.** `routing-brief` is the thin task-writer index: dispatchable agent roster, each agent's standing model (`Config.agent_model/1`), model availability/blocks, and per-agent KPI rollups — every metric carries `n`, no ranking. A model-capable agent with no configured model shows `model: nil, model_required: true`.
- **Scout routing (advisory).** `dispatch-recommend` returns the cross-family scout AI's per-facet `:exploit` pick (with rationale) or a safe `:explore` / `:fallback_no_data` when a facet is unmeasured; `dispatch-assess_facets` forces a fresh scout assessment. The caller decides whether to dispatch the pick — legacy composite scores are not used for routing.
- **Model is required, never defaulted.** Implementer precedence: **task `model` → `{:agent_model, agent}` → REJECT** (`{:model_required, agent}`) — harness never falls through to the CLI's ambient default. The **reviewer has no task-pin axis**: its model comes solely from `{:agent_model, agent}` for the reviewer adapter's agent (`Run.reviewer_model/1`), and a model-capable reviewer with no configured model is rejected *before* the reviewer spawns. `antigravity` (no `--model` flag) is the lone model-incapable exemption.
- **Block exhausted premium models.** A monthly budget can exhaust (e.g. cursor-Opus) while harness still lists the pair as available and routes to it. `model_availability-block_model` (with a `blocked_until` window) removes the pair from routing/cron; `model_availability-unblock_model` clears it.
- **Cost-aware A/B.** `dispatch-compare` runs one task across N adapters (optional per-adapter model overrides) and returns per-adapter `verdict` / `reviewer_diff_size` / `duration_ms` / `token_usage` for selection.

### Reading the Verdict

| `state` / `reason` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `:done` / `:approved` | Reviewer AI approved (possibly after inline fixes — check `reviewer_diff_size`). | Deliverable on `harness/<run-id>`. Review diff, integrate (or let auto-lander handle it), `rmap status <id> done`. |
| `:failed` / `{:review_rejected, report}` | Reviewer rejected (degenerate — near-never by design). | Read `report`. Task back in queue; re-dispatch. |
| `:failed` / `{:review_stuck, report}` | No verdict: reviewer unavailable, crashed, or missing/malformed `.harness/review.json`. | Read `report`. Fix environment or re-dispatch. |
| `:failed` / `{:worktree_failed,_}` `{:agent_spawn_failed,_}` `{:driver_crashed,_}` `{:commit_failed,_}` | Harness-side mechanical failure. | **Harness bug.** File via `rmap new`. |
| `:failed` / `{:checkout_polluted, status}` | Agent wrote outside the run worktree into the main checkout — surfaces as `:failed` **only after bounded AI recovery was exhausted** (see "Self-healing recovery" below). | Recovery declared the run dead. Likely an agent/adapter isolation issue; re-dispatch with a worktree-honoring adapter. |
| `:failed` / `{:checkout_pollution_check_failed, _}` | Post-run pollution `git status` errored. | Rare; transient git/IO. Re-run; inspect checkout if persistent. |
| `:failed` / `:timed_out` | Lifetime budget elapsed. | Raise `:lifetime_timeout` or investigate hang. |
| run process **crashed** (no settle) | gen_statem died. | **Harness bug.** File via `rmap new`. |

Failed runs retain the worktree at `result.worktree_path` for inspection. Approved runs keep branch `harness/<run-id>` after worktree teardown. Use `dispatch-verdict_detail` for the reviewer report, ratings, checks, concerns, warning flag, and `reviewer_diff_size` — no harness-run mechanical per-check stdout.

**The verdict artifact** `.harness/review.json` is `{verdict, report, checks, concerns, facets, skills, ratings}`: `verdict` (`approve`/`reject`) is the gate; `report` is the reviewer's prose; `checks` is the reviewer-written record of commands run and their pass/fail claim; `concerns` is the reviewer's self-flagged caveat list; **`facets`** (open-vocabulary routing KEY — the kind of task) and **`skills`** (v0_13 two-axis rubric, routing VALUE) feed per-facet capability routing; `ratings` is the legacy flat-score fallback. Approved runs with non-empty concerns or a reviewer-authored failed check surface a warning fact; harness never auto-blocks or classifies prose. The artifact lives under `.harness/` (excluded from staging) so it never rides in the deliverable commit.

**Self-healing recovery (the `:recovering` state).** Before settling `:failed` for an *interpretive* non-rejection failure — checkout pollution is currently the one wired call-site — the run spawns a **bounded cross-family recovery AI** (`:recovering` state, budget 1/run) with minimal context (the error term + the main checkout's `git status` + the implementer transcript tail + the failing-check output, never the full transcript). It writes `.harness/recovery.json` `{outcome: "repaired"|"dead", report, repaired}`; harness reads it mechanically and **decides nothing itself**: `repaired` resumes at `:committing` and **re-runs the reviewer gate** (never skips to `:done`); `dead` / missing / malformed settles `:failed` with the original reason. A genuine `verdict: reject` is never routed through recovery. The `Result` carries `recovery_attempts` / `recovery_outcome` / `recovery_repaired` / `recovery_token_usage`. (Tier-1 mechanical self-heal precedes it: the reviewer is re-prompted once on a missing/malformed `review.json` — `reviewer_reprompt_count`, capped at 1 — and rotates to the next cross-family candidate on a reviewer timeout — `reviewer_rotation_count`.)

### 🚨 Recover, Don't Redo — Never Burn Tokens Re-Implementing Committed Work

**A run that committed to `harness/<run-id>` already paid for the implementer. Recovering that branch costs a fraction of a fresh dispatch — re-dispatching from `pending` throws the work away and makes the agent redo all of it.** The reflex to "reset → pending → dispatch again" is a token bonfire whenever a retained branch with commits exists. Check for the branch *first*; pick the cheapest primitive that fits:

| Run state — committed `harness/<run-id>` branch exists | Recover with | Agent tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Approved but unlanded (land-cap, lander crash) | `dispatch-reland` | **zero** — pure git rebase + push |
| Committed, review-stage failure (work is good) | `dispatch-rereview` | zero implementer — re-enters at the reviewer gate |
| Committed, implement-stage incomplete/`:failed` | `dispatch-resume_failed` (`escalate: true` to re-route agent) | **re-spends implementer tokens** — a fresh implementer invocation branched off the retained commits with the failure report injected (contrast `rereview`, which re-runs only the reviewer) |
| Live `:held` run (paused, not dead) | `dispatch-resume` | none — un-pauses in place |
| **No commits / no retained branch** | reset → `pending` + fresh `dispatch-task` | full redo — **the only case where this is correct** |

**Live-run intervention (not recovery of a dead run):** `dispatch-hold` (optionally `interrupt: true`) parks a live run mid-turn, `dispatch-steer` stashes guidance applied on resume, `dispatch-resume` un-pauses in place, `dispatch-cancel` kills it (idempotent). Use hold → steer → resume to force-hand a grinding implementer to the reviewer gate instead of burning the lifetime budget.

**The gate before any reset-to-pending + re-dispatch:** `git branch -a | grep harness/<run-id>` and `git log --oneline origin/<target>..harness/<run-id>`. Commits present ⇒ recover, never redo.

**🚨 First, confirm the run actually *didn't* land — check `origin`, not your local checkout.** Under `landing_policy: :auto` the lander pushes to `origin/<target>` and **deliberately never touches your local checkout** (it ff-pushes from a detached worktree). So after an autonomous land your local `tasks.toml` is **stale**: it still reads `in_progress` for a task the lander already marked `done --shipped-in` on origin. **Reading that stale local status as "the run didn't land" is the trap** — it triggers a wasteful reset-to-`pending` + re-dispatch that *duplicate-lands already-shipped work*. Before concluding anything from task status, `git fetch origin <target> && git rebase origin/<target>` (the existing "Sync development before committing" rule) or read ground truth directly:
- `git log --oneline origin/<target>` — does it already show `task <id> -> done (shipped …)` and the agent-delivery commit? Then it **landed**; your local view was just behind. Do nothing but rebase.
- `dispatch-status <run-id>` / `result_store-list_run_records run_id:<id>` — a record with `state: done, verdict: approve` means the run succeeded; cross-check landing against origin before touching the roadmap.

> **Observed 2026-06-12 (the cautionary tale this section exists for):** three approved runs (246/249/251) landed cleanly to `origin/development` — `done --shipped-in`, audited. But the operator's local checkout hadn't rebased, so `rmap show` read stale `in_progress`. That was misread as "approved but didn't land," the tasks were reset to `pending` and re-dispatched, and task 246 **landed a second time** (duplicate delivery) before the mistake surfaced. Root cause: reading stale local state instead of rebasing on `origin` first. The lander was working perfectly the whole time.

The recovery primitives (`reland`/`rereview`/`resume_failed`) read the persisted `ResultStore` record, which **survives** worktree teardown and node restarts — so a genuinely approved-but-unlanded run (lander hit its land-cap, or a real rebase conflict retained the branch) is recoverable token-free via `dispatch-reland`. Reserve reset-to-`pending` for runs with **no committed branch and no settled record** — and only after confirming against `origin` that the work isn't already shipped.

### Parallel Dispatch

`Harness.Run.Supervisor` is a `DynamicSupervisor` — N crash-isolated runs, each with its own worktree.

- **Batch by dependency graph, then write-set.** Every pending task whose `depends_on` is satisfied can enter the ready set, but harness dispatches only the first wave whose `touches ∪ files_to_modify` are disjoint. Overlapping tasks wait for a later wave after the landed base moves forward.
- **Keep write-set fields accurate.** The dispatcher counts declared path intersections; it does not infer paths from the task body. If two tasks really edit the same function, either let write-set serialization sequence them or fold the coupled work into one rmap task (`task-prioritization.md` § "Refine, Don't Duplicate").
- **One driver BEAM** for all concurrent runs in a wave.
- **Integration order (manual landing):** smallest/isolated diffs onto target first; rebase siblings; run the project's check command on target after last merge.
- **While a wave is in flight:** do not run `rmap status` / `rmap mark` / `rmap new` in parallel sessions against the same checkout — triggers `:checkout_polluted` false-positive.

### Autonomous Landing

Projects with `landing_policy: :auto` and `target_branch`:

1. Approved run enqueues one job on serialized `landing_<name>` Oban queue (limit 1)
2. `Harness.Lander.land/1` rebases `harness/<run-id>` onto `origin/<target>` in a detached worktree
3. **ff-pushes without re-verification** — the reviewer already gated the work
4. Successful push enqueues post-merge audit; advances rmap (`done --verified --shipped-in <sha>`)

Conflict / push-rejected retains the branch for repair — never lands red. Witness notification (read-only sink) alerts the operator; it is **not** a merge gate.

**🚨 Settle ≠ landed — don't conflate the two signals.** `dispatch-await` / `dispatch-await_runs` block until **reviewer settle** (`state: :done, verdict: approve`, or `:failed`), which fires the *moment the reviewer approves* — **before** the serialized `landing_<name>` job rebases and ff-pushes. So an `approve` from `await_runs` means "approved and *queued* to land," **not** "on `origin/<target>`." There is **no blocking await-landed tool**; landing is async and surfaces via the witness sink (`Harness.Notification.FileSink` tailing `~/.harness/settled.jsonl`, or `CommandSink`). To gate a next wave on the base actually moving forward, await settle **then** confirm the land against origin once (`git fetch origin <target> && git log --oneline origin/<target>` for the `task <id> -> done (shipped …)` commit) or consume the witness event — never treat approval as landed. This is the same root cause as the duplicate-land trap above, seen from the dispatch side: a poll loop watching `origin` for the landing commit is a workaround for a *fixed* `await_runs`, not a substitute for it — await settles, origin confirms the land.

**Cron manual-approval mode.** A per-project cron poller in `:auto` mode dispatches unattended; in `:manual` mode it **parks** each dispatch decision instead of enqueuing — drain the parked decisions with `dispatch-pending` and approve them with `dispatch-approve`, keeping the orchestrator in the loop for autonomous polling.

### Orchestrator Loop — the Architect Seat the Per-Task Reviewer Can't Fill

The sections above document the *mechanisms*; this is the **continuous loop** the driving AI runs across waves:

```
plan wave → dispatch → await settle → confirm land on origin → run integration suite on the landed base
          ↑                                                     + review whole surface vs roadmap intent & domain invariants
          └── reconcile rmap ← encode any whole-surface finding as a criterion/test ←┘
```

Each arrow reuses an existing mechanism — don't restate them here: *await settle* (§ "Settle ≠ landed"), *confirm land on origin* (§ "Recover, Don't Redo" → the duplicate-land trap), *reconcile rmap* (the lander already advanced `done --shipped-in` under auto-land — verify, don't double-write), *next wave* (§ "Parallel Dispatch" + write-set serialization).

**🚨 Three review seats, each blind where the next sees — the orchestrator seat is mandatory, not optional.** The per-task reviewer gates *one diff against one task* and is **structurally blind** to two defect classes that land clean through it (worked evidence: delta_calc tasks 24/25/26, see its `## Review Blind Spots` / `## Domain Invariants`):

| Seat | What it sees | What it CANNOT see |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-task reviewer** (cross-family, the gate) | one diff vs one task's acceptance criteria + mechanical checks, in an isolated worktree off a base | the whole surface; domain ground truth |
| **Post-merge audit AI** (best-effort) | cold build of the merged commit range; hygiene | whether a domain constant is *wrong*; roadmap-intent fit |
| **Orchestrator** (the architect seat — you) | whole integrated surface vs roadmap intent + domain invariants across all landed waves | — (this is the seat of last resort) |

The two blind classes, both real-correctness, both passing every per-task check:

- **Domain ground truth** — a wrong venue constant (`@funding_periods_per_day 3`, overstating Deribit's hourly funding ~8×) is internally consistent and fully tested *because the golden was computed with the same wrong constant* — coverage ratifies the bug. The reviewer has no signal; that knowledge lives in the architect's head.
- **Cross-module global invariants** — write-set-disjoint parallel dispatch means two worktrees can each define `project_payback_timeline` and neither review sees the other; the collision only exists once both have landed on the integrated base. Only a whole-surface seat catches it.

**🚨 Run the integration suite on the landed base — this is NOT redundant with per-task review.** After each wave lands, run the project's full check (`mix ci` / `mix precommit.full`) on the freshly-landed `origin/<target>`. The per-task reviewer ran its checks in an *isolated worktree off an earlier base, before sibling waves landed* — cross-module breakage doesn't exist until multiple landed diffs coexist. This generalizes the manual-landing-only "run the project's check command on target after last merge" (§ "Parallel Dispatch") into a standing per-wave step.

**Two framing guards — keep this consistent with the harness mantra:**

- **It's an agent seat, not harness code.** The mantra ("count facts in code; judge with an AI") forbids *harness* computing meaning — it does **not** forbid the orchestrator AI from reviewing the whole surface or running the suite. This adds no mechanical gate to harness; it's judgment in an agent, which is exactly where judgment belongs.
- **The output crystallizes into encoded invariants — don't leave it a manual sweep.** When the architect seat catches a whole-surface or domain defect, the highest-value move is not the manual catch — it's pushing the rule into an **acceptance criterion or a manifest-wide CI test** (the delta_calc rule) so the per-task gate absorbs that class going forward. Orchestrator review *feeds* the criteria/CI; it must not become a permanent re-review of every diff. A finding caught twice by hand is a missing test.

### Portfolio Conventions

- **Agent does not commit unless asked.** Staged-but-uncommitted is the default handoff between implementer and reviewer sessions (`workflow-philosophy.md` § "Implementer / Reviewer Handoff"). Harness runs commit agent work to `harness/<run-id>` automatically — that is harness's deliverable branch, not the operator's main checkout.
- **Witness notification is sakshi (read-only).** Landing outcomes notify via configured command sink; the sink grants no merge capability. Human operator reviews blocked/conflict outcomes — harness does not silently force-push past conflicts.
- **`check_command` is a hint to the reviewer.** Free text (e.g. `"mix precommit.full"`) — the reviewer runs and judges it; harness does not execute it mechanically.
- **The cross-family reviewer reads `AGENTS.md`, not your Claude skills/includes.** `AGENTS.md` is generated from `CLAUDE.md` by `claude-marketplace/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh`, which recursively inlines every `@`-import. **Regenerate it after any `CLAUDE.md` change** (`bash ~/_DATA/code/claude-marketplace/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh`, or `--dry-run` to preview) so the reviewer gates against current rules — a stale `AGENTS.md` makes codex/cursor/grok judge against rules you've already changed. **`--check` is the freshness gate** — it re-renders in memory and exits non-zero if `AGENTS.md` has drifted (diffs rendered output, not mtimes, so it catches drift in transitive `@`-imports too); wire it into CI / a pre-commit hook / the `check_command` so staleness fails loudly instead of silently. Consequence under Opus-4.8 skill-on-demand: once `CLAUDE.md` slims to the eager floor, reviewer-critical facts that *were* carried by eager includes (the `check_command` gate; that `mix test.json` / `mix dialyzer.json` emit JSON **by design** — parse for real failures, never flag the envelope; plain `mix dialyzer` is authoritative when the JSON encoder can't serialize a warning) no longer reach `AGENTS.md` via those imports. Put them in a **self-contained `## Toolchain & check commands` section in `CLAUDE.md`** so they survive the slim-down and flow into `AGENTS.md` on regen (ref: `tapakly/CLAUDE.md`, `ccxt_extract/CLAUDE.md`).
- **Delegation roster — opus last, and don't over-default to codex.** When assigning a dispatchable task to a harness adapter, prefer the external agents — **cursor, codex, grok** — and reserve the **claude/opus** adapter for work that genuinely needs it (harness-surface changes, judgment-heavy review, tasks the cheaper adapters keep bouncing). Opus tokens are precious: spend them last, not by default. Mix adapters across a wave for review coverage. A repo may override the roster in its own CLAUDE.md.
  - **Observed failure mode: reflex-routing everything to `codex`.** Run ledgers skew heavily codex-over-cursor/grok. Actively spread `assignee` across all three; reserve codex for tasks it's genuinely scored best on, not as the default.
  - **`cursor` runs on Composer (`composer-2.5`) by default — and that's the data-backed pick.** Pin `model = "composer-2.5"` for cursor work: it's the cheapest cost-to-green in the ledger, and **every cursor capability KPI is measured on Composer** (it's a multi-model front-end, but the scores you'd route on reflect Composer, not whatever you pin). The `composer-2.5-fast` variant is cheaper still, but its budget routinely exhausts and the operator blocks it — so **`composer-2.5` (non-fast) is the standing default**; confirm the live id with `cursor-agent --list-models` / `model_availability-list_available_models cursor`. A heavier cursor model exists (`cursor-agent --list-models` lists `claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high` etc.) but is **not** the default, carries **no** capability data, and draws a *monthly Opus token budget that exhausts* (when spent the operator blocks it and routes Opus-grade work to codex/gpt-5.5) — pinning it *claims performance the ledger doesn't show*, so reach for it only with a concrete, named reason, not as the "design-heavy/Opus-grade" reflex. Model IDs churn; confirm with `cursor-agent --list-models`. **`model` is REQUIRED at creation for any non-`human` assignee** (`rmap new` rejects a model-less dispatchable task — "a dispatchable task must pin the LLM it runs on"; see `rmap.md` § "Pinning an LLM model"); "leave `model` unset for the agent default" does NOT work. Set `assignee` **and** `model` at task creation per `rmap.md`.

### Known Sharp Edges

- **Fresh worktrees lack `deps/` / `_build/`.** Implementer and reviewer each run project bootstrap (e.g. `mix deps.get`) when needed — budget timeouts for cold worktrees.
- **Reviewer runs the checks.** No mechanical check stack. Correct-but-not-pristine work → reviewer fixes and approves (`reviewer_diff_size` > 0).
- **Cold dialyzer PLT** dominates first reviewer check run in Elixir worktrees.
- **Nested Claude auth.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` shadows subscription OAuth — scrub per run (`scrub_anthropic_key: true` or `env: %{"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" => false}`).
- **Parallel-session rmap mutations** during a run can false-positive `:checkout_polluted` — wait for the wave or use a separate worktree.

# Onchain Stack Workspace — Harness

Workspace-specific layout for the seven onchain repos under ZenHive, driven by the **harness** OTP loop (implement → review → land). Pairs with `harness-workflow.md` (the portfolio-wide contract): that file carries the loop shape; this file carries only the onchain-stack specifics — repo roster, on-disk paths, and cross-repo dependency coordination.

Imported family-wide by the seven repos below. The retired Linear-as-queue + Codex/Cursor cloud-delegation workspace lives in `onchain-workspace-delegation.md` (DORMANT).

### Repo Roster

| On-disk path | Repo | Role | Native deps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/_DATA/code/hieroglyph` | hieroglyph | ABI encode/decode library (`ABI.*`) | none (yecc/leex) |
| `~/_DATA/code/cartouche` | cartouche | Ethereum substrate: signing, tx encoding, raw RPC, crypto | none |
| `~/_DATA/code/onchain` | onchain | Core primitives on top of cartouche: RPC wrappers, ABI, ERC standards, signing | none |
| `~/_DATA/code/onchain_aave` | onchain_aave | Aave V3 protocol wrappers | none |
| `~/_DATA/code/onchain_evm` | onchain_evm | EVM simulation, Solidity parsing, trace, codegen | Rust NIFs (Rustler) |
| `~/_DATA/code/onchain_js` | onchain_js | npm packages on the BEAM via QuickBEAM | Zig NIFs |
| `~/_DATA/code/onchain_tempo` | onchain_tempo | Tempo chain primitives (0x76 tx, TIP-20) | none |

### Dependency Shape (drives cross-repo coordination)

```
hieroglyph (ABI)
    ↑
cartouche (substrate: signing, RPC, crypto)
    ↑
onchain (core primitives)
    ↑
  ┌─────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
onchain_aave  onchain_evm   onchain_js   onchain_tempo
```

- **hieroglyph release → cartouche bump → onchain bump → downstream bumps.** A new hieroglyph minor cascades up the chain. Sequence the harness tasks: land the upstream bump first, then dispatch the dependent bump against the updated `development`.
- **onchain core API change → onchain_aave / onchain_evm / onchain_js / onchain_tempo cascading bumps.** Loose coupling — downstream bumps can land in any order once `onchain` ships. File one rmap task per downstream repo.
- **cartouche-as-dep change** affects the whole EVM stack identically — same upstream-first ordering as a hieroglyph release.
- **Same-function collisions across repos don't exist** (separate codebases), but a single conceptual change spanning repos is still N tasks, one per repo — not one bundled task. See `harness-workflow.md` § "Parallel Dispatch".

### Branch & Workflow Conventions

- **No PRs for routine work** — completed harness runs ff-merge directly to each repo's `development` branch (the default). Manual hand-build work commits/merges to `development` directly too. (hieroglyph additionally files PRs *upstream* to `exthereum/abi` — orthogonal to harness, see its `upstream-pr-workflow.md`.)
- **Run branches** are `harness/<run-id>` per repo, created off the dispatch branch's `HEAD`. Approved work keeps the branch after worktree teardown.
- **Per-repo task source** is each repo's `roadmap/tasks.toml` (rmap renders `ROADMAP.md`). Harness ingests it as the run queue.

### Harness Specifics — TODO (stubs)

These firm up as the harness conventions for the stack settle. Fill in from the running harness node rather than guessing:

- **TODO: Project registry.** Which of the seven repos are registered in `Harness.ProjectRegistry`, their registered names, dispatch branches, and `check_command` hints. Pull live via `mcp__harness__project_registry-list`.
- **TODO: Landing policy per repo.** Which repos run `landing_policy: :auto` (ff-merge + post-merge audit) vs manual landing. Onchain repo's "no PRs / merge to development" stance suggests `:auto` once trusted.
- **TODO: Reviewer pairing.** Cross-family reviewer adapter assignment per repo, if stack-specific (the portfolio default — "opus last," prefer cursor/codex/grok — lives in `harness-workflow.md` § "Portfolio Conventions").
- **TODO: rmap roadmap paths.** Confirm each repo's `roadmap/tasks.toml` location and any per-repo D/B/U scoring conventions.

Tempo blockchain primitives for Elixir. Extracted from MPP (Machine Payments Protocol) to provide standalone 0x76 transaction handling, TIP-20 encoding, RPC, and event parsing.

**Repo:** [ZenHive/onchain_tempo](https://github.com/ZenHive/onchain_tempo) | **Org:** ZenHive

> **Cross-family reviewers:** the `.json` mix tasks (`mix test.json`, `mix dialyzer.json`) emit JSON **by design** — parse it for real failures, never flag the envelope as a build error. Full toolchain/check-command contract for codex/cursor/grok reviewers is in `AGENTS.md` § "Toolchain & check commands".

## Commands

```bash
mix test.json --quiet              # Unit tests (AI-friendly JSON)
mix test.json --quiet --failed     # Re-run failures
mix test.json --quiet --include integration  # + integration tests
mix dialyzer.json --quiet          # Type checking
mix credo --strict --format json   # Static analysis
mix sobelow                        # Security scanner
mix doctor                         # Docs/specs coverage
mix format                         # Auto-format (Styler)
```

## Architecture

This is a **library** (not a Phoenix app). It provides Tempo-specific blockchain primitives that any Elixir project can use.

### Module Map

```
OnchainTempo                       — Root module, Discoverable entry point
Onchain.Tempo.TIP20                — TIP-20 selectors, calldata encoders, DEX address
Onchain.Tempo.Transaction          — 0x76 struct, deserialize, payment matching, fee payer co-signing
Onchain.Tempo.Transaction.Builder  — Build + sign 0x76 transactions from scratch
Onchain.Tempo.RPC                  — broadcast_async/sync, fetch_receipt, parse_receipt, simulate (pre-broadcast eth_simulateV1)
Onchain.Tempo.Transfer             — TransferWithMemo event log parsing
Onchain.Tempo.Faucet               — Moderato testnet faucet (tempo_fundAddress) wrapper
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Signing uses Curvy directly** — Tempo 0x76 is non-standard; `Onchain.Signer` handles EIP-1559 only. Direct `Cartouche.Signer.Curvy` + `Cartouche.Recover.find_recid/3` is correct.
- **TIP20 owns all selectors** — Single source of truth, eliminates duplication.
- **RPC uses plain errors** — `{:error, "message"}` not wrapped error structs.
- **ExRLP is transitive** — Available via onchain → cartouche. `@dialyzer` suppressions needed.

### Dependencies

- `onchain` — Core Ethereum utilities (RPC, ABI, signing, logs)
- `req` — HTTP client for RPC calls
- `jason` — JSON encoding for RPC payloads
- `descripex` — Self-describing APIs
- `plug` — Required for Req.Test stubs (dev/test only)

### Tempo Network Chain IDs

| Network | Chain ID | RPC URL |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Mainnet | `4217` | `https://rpc.tempo.xyz` |
| Moderato (testnet) | `42431` | `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz` |

### Dialyzer Notes

Dialyzer shows `unknown_function` warnings for transitive deps when using onchain as a path dep. This is a known issue shared with onchain_aave — the path dep's transitive deps aren't fully resolved in the PLT. These are false positives.

### Conventions

- Styler is the formatter plugin (runs automatically via `mix format`)
- `test/support/` is compiled in test env
- Integration tests live under `test/onchain/tempo/integration/`, tagged `:integration`, excluded by default. They self-fund fresh wallets via the Moderato `tempo_fundAddress` faucet RPC — no env var required. Override the endpoint with `TEMPO_RPC_URL`.
- All calldata functions accept raw binaries (20-byte addresses, 32-byte memos), not hex strings
- Error format: `{:ok, result} | {:error, String.t()}`
